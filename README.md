# Key features:

- Writing and compiling a custom kernel module.
- Adding and registering a new system call in the kernel.
- Testing the system call with user-space programs.


This project demonstrates the creation of a custom Linux kernel module that adds a new system call to the kernel. 
The module integrates with the existing kernel structure and showcases how to modify kernel space, interact with user space, 
and handle kernel-level operations. The testing phase involves invoking the custom system call from a user-space program to 
verify its correct implementation and behavior.
