# Project Description

- Earliest Deadline First Scheduling Algorithm Implementation in C

This C program schedules processes using the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm. The user interactively inputs the number of 
processes, along with each process's required CPU time and period. 
The program computes and prints the schedule from time 0 up to the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of all periods. 
If multiple processes have the same deadline, the oldest process is prioritized for scheduling.
