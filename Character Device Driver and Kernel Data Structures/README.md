# Project Description

This project extends a character device driver by implementing a new IOCTL command to access kernel data structures, specifically the task_struct (task control block) within the Linux kernel. A user space program is also extended to interact with the driver and test the functionality of the new IOCTL command, ensuring proper communication between user space and kernel space.
